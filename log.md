## Experiments log
- 01/06 [Giacomo] HashingVectorizer tried instead of TF-IDF, not better
- 04/06 [Giacomo] Random Forest classifiers investigated, bad performances that might be explained by the sparsity of the data
- 05/06 [Giacomo] t-NSE + PCA to plot feature space
- 06/06 [Giacomo] Experimented with standard machine learning approaches on character n-grams TF-IDF, ensemble of character and word level classifiers, none of which outperformed logistic regression over word-level TF-IDF
- 06/06 [Giacomo] Tried to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors with PCA (to 500 and 1000 dimensions), achieved very bad results
